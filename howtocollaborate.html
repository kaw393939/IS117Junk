How you work with a partner - You need to add your partner gitID to the repo you will work from or you have to use a fork

Note: this is after you clone the repo for the first time
1.  If there could be a change on remote master - Rebase Remote Master onto your current local master
2.  Make a branch to complete a task
3.  Complete the task
4.  Do the commit and push the branch to github
5.  Create a pull request on github and merge the code to master (hopefully no merge conflicts)
6.  Merge the pull request on github
7.  Rebase the remote master onto your local master and repeat these steps for the next task
