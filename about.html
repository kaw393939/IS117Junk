Merging Local changes
This is a master Branch Change to cause a merge conflict
The good person will get this change before they start work
This merge will go in with no problem because I checked out and rebased the remote master

How you work with a partner
Note: this is after you clone the repo for the first time
1.  If there could be a change on remote master - Rebase Remote Master onto your current local master
2.  Make a branch to complete a task
3.  Complete the task
4.  Do the commit and push the branch to github
5.  Create a pull request on github and merge the code to master (hopefully no merge conflicts)
6.  Merge the pull request on github
7.  Rebase the remote master onto your local master and repeat these steps for the next task
